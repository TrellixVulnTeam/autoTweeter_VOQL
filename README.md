Tweet a message multiple times. Can be used for events where you can win prizes by tagging the organiser of the event. I used it to try to win an iPhone from a giveaway from UnboxTherapy (without success). (I also sent too many tweets so that I could not write any more tweets for the next few hours.) 

To run the program, just run main.py in the virtual environment.
In the linux terminal: 
Activate virtual environment:
`source venv/bin/activate`
Run script:
`python3 main.py`
